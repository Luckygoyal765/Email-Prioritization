# Email-Prioritization
Email Prioritization System with Tagging and Folder Abstraction

I. Description:
The Email Prioritization System enhances traditional email services by allowing users to assign custom tags to emails, which are then prioritized based on user-defined ratings. This system organizes emails into folders according to their tags and prioritizes the display of emails associated with higher-rated tags. Such a system improves user efficiency by enabling faster access to important emails and better management of inbox clutter.
This System can also be modularized into distinct, self-contained modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. These modules are :-
    1. The User Interface Module
    • Purpose: Manages the presentation layer, providing the user with tools to interact with emails, apply tags, prioritize emails, and organize folders.
    • Components:
        ◦ Email Viewing and Management Interface (Inbox, Folders)
        ◦ Tagging and Prioritization UI
        ◦ Folder Management UI
        ◦ Settings and Preferences

2. Tagging and Prioritization Module
    • Purpose: Handles the logic for creating, managing, and applying tags to emails, and determining the prioritization of emails based on user-defined tag ratings.
    • Components:
        ◦ Tag Creation and Management
        ◦ Prioritization Logic (Algorithm to sort emails by tag rating)
        ◦ Tagging Rules Engine (Automated tagging based on rules)

3. Email Storage and Retrieval Module
    • Purpose: Manages the storage of emails, tags, and folder structures on the server, and retrieves emails based on user actions and priorities.
    • Components:
        ◦ Email Database (Storage of emails, tags, and folders)
        ◦ Email Retrieval Engine (Using IMAP/POP3 protocols)
        ◦ Email Indexing (For efficient search and retrieval)

4. Synchronization and Communication Module
    • Purpose: Handles all network communications between the client and the server, ensuring data consistency across devices through real-time synchronization.
    • Components:
        ◦ IMAP/SMTP Protocol Handlers (For email sending and retrieval)
        ◦ Sync Manager (Ensures real-time syncing of emails, tags, and folders)
        ◦ Offline Sync Engine (Handles synchronization during reconnection after being offline)

5. Security and Encryption Module
    • Purpose: Ensures the security and privacy of emails, tags, and user data through encryption and secure communication channels.
    • Components:
        ◦ Data Encryption (For emails, tags, and folders)
        ◦ Secure Communication Protocols (SSL/TLS)
        ◦ Spam Filtering and Malware Detection

6. Search and Filtering Module
    • Purpose: Facilitates efficient searching and filtering of emails based on tags, content, and other criteria, providing users with quick access to relevant emails.
    • Components:
        ◦ Search Engine (Index-based search for fast retrieval)
        ◦ Filter Management (User-defined filters based on tags, sender, date, etc.)

II. Key Features:
    • Custom Tagging: Users can create and assign custom tags to emails based on content, importance, or other criteria.
    • Tag-Based Prioritization: Emails are prioritized within the inbox and folders based on the rating of their associated tags.
    • Folder Abstraction: Emails are automatically organized into folders according to their tags, providing a structured overview of messages.
    • Search and Filtering: Advanced search capabilities allow users to filter and find emails by tags, ratings, or other attributes.
    • User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive interface for managing tags, ratings, and folders.

III. Requirements:
    • Email Server: Capable of supporting tagging and prioritization features.
    • Database: For storing and managing tags, ratings, and folder structures.
    • Internet Connection: Required for syncing tags and prioritization data across devices.
    • Email Client or Webmail Interface: Must support the tagging and folder abstraction features.

IV. Design Parameters:
    • Delay Tolerance: This system is not inherently delay-tolerant; it relies on continuous network connectivity for real-time email synchronization, tagging, and prioritization, making it vulnerable to disruptions.
    • Bandwidth Sensitivity/Elasticity: This system is bandwidth-sensitive, requiring consistent network resources for optimal performance. It is not designed to adapt to varying bandwidth conditions, which may cause delays in email delivery and synchronization under low-bandwidth scenarios.
    • Timing Requirements: This system requires low latency for email delivery (seconds to minutes), quick synchronization of tags and folders (within seconds), and fast UI responsiveness (100-200 milliseconds for interactions) to ensure a smooth user experience.
    • Connection-Oriented/Less: This system is connection-oriented, relying on stable, persistent connections (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to ensure reliable email transmission, synchronization, and state maintenance across devices.

V. Architecture:
    • User Agent (Email Client/Webmail): Software that allows users to tag emails, assign ratings, and manage folders.
    • Mail Server: Stores emails, tags, ratings, and manages the prioritization logic. Components include:
        ◦ SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): For sending emails between servers.
        ◦ IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): Used for retrieving and managing emails on the server, supporting real-time synchronization with tags and folders.
    • Database Server: Manages storage of tags, ratings, and folder structures.
    • Domain Name System (DNS): Translates domain names into IP addresses for routing emails.

    • User Agent communicates with Mail Server via SMTP for sending emails and IMAP for retrieving and managing them.
    • Mail Server interacts with the Database Server to store tags, ratings, and folder structures.
    • DNS facilitates the translation of domain names for email routing.

VIII. Workplan:
    1. a. Creation of an email server with integrated DNS for prioritization and categorizations using tags on the domain name. 
    1. b. A Simple Mail Transfer Protocol to send emails via a interactive GUI (desktop application) . 

    2. Deployment of advanced securities like encryption and integration of Post Office Protocol 3 for email retrieval by server when user is inactive.
